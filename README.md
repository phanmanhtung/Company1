# Fashion Chain: Yody
Yody is a well-known fashion company in Vietnam with a large chain of supply and retail stores. Because of COVID-19, they had started to partly switch to e-commerce. The data team’s objective  was to build a Data Warehouse (OLAP) for business analysis purposes. I learnt the OLAP principles and participated in designing the UML database. Besides, I handled several ad-hoc problems: web-scrape data from influencers’ Facebook, Youtube and Tiktok; deliver sales and customer reports; make a simple gender classifier with emails as input.
